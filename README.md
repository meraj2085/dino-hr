# Dino HR

This website is an HR Management service. Businesses are served by the HR Management Service, which offers a complete system for handling important employee-related duties. HR operations with features including staff data management, performance tracking, and simple training program scheduling. For all companies, this website is comparable to a product. Any business is welcome to use our services. Additionally, a dashboard area is provided. Among our users, there are three different kinds. They are Super Admin, Admin, and Employees. Super Admin administrators keep an eye on the hierarchy of administrators and make sure that HR processes are handled properly across the board. An admin for the company will be created by our super admin from here. The administrator has complete control over every aspect of each employee's work. A business that uses this website to manage its employees can do things like control their attendance, leave and events and so on.
